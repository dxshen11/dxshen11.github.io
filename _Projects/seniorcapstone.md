Goal:
+ Develop a fully autonomous robot within a 1’x1’ envelope that can manipulate a 1.5 cubic inch wooden cube to perform actions such as stacking, relocation, etc.

Work Completed:
+ Aided in CAD which was completed in Solidworks and prototyping, which was done using a laser cutter and FDM 3D printer.
+ Created a ‘digital twin’ using MATLAB Simscape Multibody, modeling the linkage kinematics, DC motors with PID control, RGB sensor input, and frictional contact forces.
+ Achieved 2nd Best Team award in the largest capstone section for the 2020 graduating class.
