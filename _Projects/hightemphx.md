Goal:
+ Design a novel high temperature shell and tube heat exchanger for aerospace applications with requirements specified by ARPA-E for the HITEMMP program. 
+ Project completed in a team for a graduate course on high temperature design.

Work Completed:
+ Designed a model in Solidworks based on the TEMA standard chart for heat exchangers. 
+ Set up and performed structural analyses in COMSOL for thermal expansion and pressure expansion in both linear elastic and plastic regimes. 
+ Analyzed results for failure conditions and developed factors of safety for different loading conditions.
+ Created a final report available documenting design procedure and final analysis on request.
