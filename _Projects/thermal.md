## Invetech: Thermal Testbed

<img src="/assets/thermal testbed.png" alt="logo" class = 'centered'>

Goal:
+ To study the amount of fluid left in the consumable device after evacuation due to interfacial phenomena.
+ Develop the optimal geometry for fluid evacuation and decide on final model for the microfluidic device.

Work Completed:
+ The consumable mount was hand milled on a Bridgeport mill, with two DMMs nearby to measure temperature, and the system was heated via a resistive heater.
+ Additional hardware was sourced from the machine shop and jigged together to create the testbed structure.
+ Hand calculations were completed to determine multiple characteristics (heating time, max temps, etc.).
