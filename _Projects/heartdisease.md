Goal:
+ Compare the performance between logistic regression and a keras/keras-tuned neural network model for binary classification of heart disease.
+ Project completed for a graduate course on machine learning.

Work Completed:
+ Developed visualizations for the data and logistic regression model. 
+ Set up keras neural network, used keras-tuner in order to find the optimal hyperparameters for the network.
