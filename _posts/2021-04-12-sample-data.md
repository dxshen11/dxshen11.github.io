Hi there! My name is Dennis Shen and I am curently a mechanical engineer at Applied Mateerials. I hold both a M.S. and B.S. in mechanical engineering from UCLA. This is my personal portfolio website, where I have chosen to highlight some of my previous work experiences and projects. Additionally, the contents of this website may change every so often, so feel free to check back when you want! The website is built by me using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, with the 'Steve' theme from Jekyll Themes.
