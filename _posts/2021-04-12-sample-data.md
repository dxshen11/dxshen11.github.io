Hi there! My name is Dennis Shen and I am curently a mechanical engineer at Applied Materials. I hold both a M.S. and B.S. in mechanical engineering from UCLA. This is my personal portfolio website, where I have chosen to highlight some of my previous work experiences and projects. Many of the projects I have worked on are under strict IP safeguards, so these projects only represent a portion of the engineering work I have come across.

The website is built by me using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, with the 'Steve' theme from Jekyll Themes.
