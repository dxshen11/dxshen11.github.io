<p>Goal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a fully autonomous robot within a 1â€™x1â€™ envelope that can manipulate a 1.5 cubic inch wooden cube to perform actions such as stacking, relocation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work Completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aided in CAD which was completed in Solidworks and prototyping, which was done using a laser cutter and FDM 3D printer.</li>
  <li>Created a â€˜digital twinâ€™ using MATLAB Simscape Multibody, modeling the linkage kinematics, DC motors with PID control, RGB sensor input, and frictional contact forces.</li>
  <li>Achieved 2nd Best Team award in the largest capstone section for the 2020 graduating class.</li>
</ul>
