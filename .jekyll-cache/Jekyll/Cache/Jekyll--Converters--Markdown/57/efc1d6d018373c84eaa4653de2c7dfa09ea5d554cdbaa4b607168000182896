<p>Working at the UCLA MakerSpace was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences during my time as an undergraduate student. The goal of the organization was to provide a space where students of all backgrounds could learn the skills needed to work on whatever idea or project they had in mind.</p>

<p>I helped manage the following tools listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Laser cutter</li>
  <li>FDM 3D Printers</li>
  <li>SLA 3D Printers</li>
  <li>Desktop CNC Mill</li>
  <li>Soldering station</li>
  <li>Heat press</li>
  <li>Embroidery machine</li>
</ul>

<p>As a mechanical engineering student, I taught workshops in CAD (mainly Autodesk Fusion 360 and Solidworks) on a regular basis, and was largely in charge of repair, maintenance, and management of the 10 or so FDM printers and 2 SLA printers. As a technician, I took apart and put back together almost every inch of our 3D printers in the almost 2 years I worked at the MakerSpace.</p>
