<p>I interned in the manufacturing engineering department at Crane Aerospace &amp; Electronics in Burbank in the summer of 2020. Crane A&amp;E designs and manufactures a variety of aerospace equipment, with a focus on brake control systems for commerical and military aircraft.</p>

<p>One key project I worked on was implementing a new CNC lathe program to increase the production rate of 3 different control system components. I assembled the cross functional team (design engineers, machinists, CNC programmers, and manufacturing engineers), participated in the manufacturing review, and selected the tooling for the CNC lathe. This project achieved savings for this production line of $45,000 per year.</p>

<p>The other project I was involved in was the development of a custom flow plotting device for the Test Engineering team. This goal of this device was to compare fluid flow versus sleeve position of a sliding sleeve assembly. 
The data acquisition was performed using a NI DAQ and LabVIEW, and the data was fed into a Python script to perform numerical analysis.</p>
