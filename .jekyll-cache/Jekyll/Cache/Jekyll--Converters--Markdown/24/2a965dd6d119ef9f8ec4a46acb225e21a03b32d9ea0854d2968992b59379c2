<p>Goal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design a novel high temperature shell and tube heat exchanger for aerospace applications with requirements specified by ARPA-E for the HITEMMP program.</li>
  <li>Project completed in a team for a graduate course on high temperature design.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work Completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed a model in Solidworks based on the TEMA standard chart for heat exchangers.</li>
  <li>Set up and performed structural analyses in COMSOL for thermal expansion and pressure expansion in both linear elastic and plastic regimes.</li>
  <li>Analyzed results for failure conditions and developed factors of safety for different loading conditions.</li>
  <li>Created a final report available documenting design procedure and final analysis on request.</li>
</ul>
