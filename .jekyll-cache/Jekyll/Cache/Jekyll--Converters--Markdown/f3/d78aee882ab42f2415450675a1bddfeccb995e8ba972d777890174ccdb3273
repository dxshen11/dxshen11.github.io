<p>As an undergraduate researcher, I joined the Billi Lab at the UCLA Orthopedic Hospital Research Center to investigate the application of additive manufacturing in biomaterials and surgical rehersal.</p>

<p>During my time, I became incredibly familiar with the labâ€™s FDM and SLA 3D printers (an ANET A8, Prusa i3 MK 2S, and Formlabs Form 2). Along with another researcher, I changed out the ANETâ€™s power supply, control board (default to MKS Gen 1.4), firmware, bed material, and implemented new support structures for rigidity.</p>

<p>Using the modified ANET, I also tested a couple of different orthopedic grade polymers in order to find the optimal printing profiles. The ultimate goal of the project was to be able to take in 3D scans of a patient pre-surgery, print out the bone structure, and allow orthopedic surgeons to practice surgical procedures for complicated operations. One other side project that I helped out with was printing small ring-like structures to act as blood clotting targets using biocompatible resin on the Formlabs Form 2.</p>
