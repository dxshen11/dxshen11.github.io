<p>Goal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To study the amount of fluid left in the consumable device after evacuation due to interfacial phenomena.</li>
  <li>Develop the optimal geometry for fluid evacution and decide on final model for the microfluidic device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work Completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The consumable mount was hand milled on a Brideport mill, with two DMMs nearby to measure temperature, and the system was heated via a resistive heater.</li>
  <li>Additional hardware was sourced from the machine shop and jigged together to create the testbed structure.</li>
  <li>Hand calculations were completed to determine multiple characteristics (heating time, max temps, etc.).</li>
</ul>
