description: The UCLA MakerSpace at Rieber Hall is a fabrication shop that provides tools and equipment, such as 3D printers, a CNC mill, woodworking tools, a laser cutter, and much more to students free of charge. I worked there for almost 2 years a shop technician, overseeing all equipment and repairs.

Working at the UCLA MakerSpace was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences during my time as an undergraduate student. The goal of the organization was to provide a space where students of all backgrounds could learn the skills needed to work on whatever idea or project they had in mind. 

I helped manage the following tools listed below:
+ Laser cutter
+ FDM 3D Printers
+ SLA 3D Printers
+ Desktop CNC Mill
+ Soldering station
+ Heat press 
+ Embroidery machine

As a mechanical engineering student, I taught workshops in CAD (mainly Autodesk Fusion 360 and Solidworks) on a regular basis, and was largely in charge of repair, maintenance, and management of the 10 or so FDM printers and 2 SLA printers. As a technician, I took apart and put back together almost every inch of our 3D printers in the almost 2 years I worked at the MakerSpace.
