## Role: Mechanical Engineering Intern

I interned in the mechanical engineering department at Invetech in San Diego for the summer of 2019. Invetech is a product development firm with expertise in medical diagnostics and consumer products.

As a mechanical engineering intern, I worked on two different diagnostic devices, supporting all efforts including prototyping, tolerance analyses, documentation, alpha testing, and test bed development. 

**Key accomplishment:**

My biggest accomplishment at Invetech was traveling out of state to deliver an alpha-level prototype to the client, setting up the system, and running biological samples within their facility to demonstrate functionality. This was all done while communicating with the engineering teams in both Melbourne, Australia and San Diego, California.    

**Skills used & developed:**
+ Solidworks
+ 3D Printing - SLA & FDM
+ Basic GD&T - Stackup Tolerance
+ Manual Milling, Bandsaw, Drill Press
