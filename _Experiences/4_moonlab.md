# Role: Simulation Researcher

As an undergraduate researcher, I worked under residents at the UCLA School of Dentistry studying the effects of an at the time - novel (now commercially available) maxillary skeletal expansion device on clinical patients. The goal of the device was to act as a non-invasive method for airway expansion and improving a patient's quality of sleep.

My area of focus was in medical imaging and computational fluid dynamics, reconstructing 3D models from CT scans in Thermo Scientific Avizo, and preparing them for CFD analysis to observe the difference in airflow pressure pre and post expansion. This research was done in collaboration with engineers at ANSYS.
