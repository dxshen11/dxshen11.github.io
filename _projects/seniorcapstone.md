title:  "Autonomous Search & Retrieval Robot"
description: "This autonomous search and retrieval robot was completed as part of my undergraduate senior capstone project. I acted as the team lead, helping guide the development of the robot in both Solidworks and MATLAB over the course of 6 months."

For the senior capstone of my undergraduate studies, I was the team lead of an autonomous search and retrieval robot over the course of 6 months. The project started as a typical hardware project controlled with a NI myRIO, but due to the onset of COVID, the final robot was fully simulated using Solidworks and MATLAB Simscape.

**Goal:**
+ Develop a fully autonomous robot within a 1’x1’ envelope that can manipulate a 1.5 cubic inch wooden cube to perform actions such as stacking, relocation, etc.

**Work Completed:**
+ Aided in CAD which was completed in Solidworks and prototyping, which was done using a laser cutter and FDM 3D printer.
+ Created a ‘digital twin’ using MATLAB Simscape Multibody, modeling the linkage kinematics, DC motors with PID control, RGB sensor input, and frictional contact forces.
+ Achieved 2nd Best Team award in the largest capstone section for the 2020 graduating class.
