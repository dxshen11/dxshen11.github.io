I joined the Invetech team in the summer of 2019 as they were developing a medical diagnostic device for a client in order to detect the presence of an infectious disease in a biological sample. The biological sample would be pipetted into a disposable cartridge, that would be inserted into the diagnostic device which would control the temperature and movement of the fluid, as well as the final disease detection.

**Goal:** <br>
The main objectives were to:
+ To study the amount of fluid left in the consumable device after evacuation due to interfacial phenomena.
+ Develop the optimal geometry for fluid evacuation and decide on final model for the microfluidic device.

**Work Completed:**
+ The consumable mount was hand milled on a Bridgeport mill, with two DMMs nearby to measure temperature, and the system was heated via a resistive heater.
+ Additional hardware was sourced from the machine shop and jigged together to create the testbed structure.
+ Hand calculations were completed to determine multiple characteristics (heating time, max temps, etc.).

Using the USB microscope, I worked with another engineer to observe the performance of a wicking ridge, and determined its effectiveness in evacuating fluid from the initial sample deposition chamber.
