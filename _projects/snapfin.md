title:  "3D Printed Attachable Surfboard Fin"
description: "As part of a graduate course on rapid prototyping, I helped design a fully 3D printable surfboard fin and base system, and validated the product using CFD and FEA."
---

This project was designed to create an easily attachable surfboard fin that could be used on a variety of different surfboards, while being cheaper and less complex to install than existing solutions. I was a part of a team of 4 that worked on the product, called SnapFin, from ideation to its prototyping stage.

**Goal:**
+ Develop a fully 3D printable product that would be compelling for a whatever industry of our choosing. The product must be fully 3D printable using a FDM machine with a build size of 220x220x214 cubic mm with a printing time constraint of 16 hours.



**Work Completed:**<br>
+ Created a 3D team logo in Solidworks with image decals and PhotoView 360.  
+ Redesigned the product to be easily 3D printable and have better drag characteristics. This included eliminating all extreme overhangs, including more filleted surfaces, and changing the shape of the buckling system to be more user friendly.
+ Performed static FEA in Solidworks Simulation based on the results of the CFD analysis, determining both maximum stresses and deflection of the fin in ocean water conditions.
